5:T580,, the Director of the WVU Center for Disability Inclusion and is PI of the Job Accommodation Network (JAN), the portal will be developed and launched in Year 1 of the CHP, hosting all products of the grant and serving as our primary vehicle for electronic dissemination. Hosted as part of JAN's online resource repository, this fully accessible, plain-language, and largely text-based resource will be populated with CHP's project findings as well as other information and resources related to the employment situation for people with disabilities experiencing Long COVID. Visitors to the portal will indicate their roles as workers with disabilities, employers, healthcare professionals, rehabilitation practitioners, researchers, government officials, policymakers, and other constituents. They will also be able to indicate their level of familiarity with the subject matter of the portal's sections, and the site will guide them to the level and type of information that is most compatible with their role and familiarity. The portal will feature multiple filters that may be applied to target users' most immediate needs. Links will be provided to JAN's other accommodation and ADA implementation resources that are part of its general website. JAN's consultants will also be available to CHP participants for any and all information they need regarding on-the-job accommodations and ADA implementation.0:{"P":null,"b":"-qlfZfK4EgJqEm-L3k-f4","p":"","c":["","pages","About","SubAwards"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["pages",{"children":["About",{"children":["SubAwards",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/794ba0e5e7611ef4.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"children":["$","main",null,{"children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"$undefined",[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]}]]}],{"children":["pages",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["About",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["SubAwards",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","$L4",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"xl:container mx-auto md:max-w-4xl max-w-sm w-8/10","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-5xl font-extrabold text-left justify-right mb-10 text-gray-800","children":"Subawards"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center justify-between","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700","children":"University of Wisconsin - Madison"}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-md font-medium text-gray-600","children":"Dr. Malachy Bishop (Subaward PI)"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex space-x-4","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/wisconsin.svg","alt":"University of Wisconsin - Madison Logo","className":"h-24 w-auto"}]}]]}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"font-semibold","children":"The University of Wisconsin - Madison"}]," will lead the Career Horizons Project's (CHP) evaluation effort, under the direction of ",["$","span",null,{"className":"font-semibold","children":"Dr. Malachy Bishop"}],", the Norman and Barbara Berven Professor in the Department of Special Education and Rehabilitation Psychology.
